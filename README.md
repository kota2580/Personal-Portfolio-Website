# Kota Narender â€” Portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS)

A lightweight, interview-focused portfolio built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JS. Responsive, fast, and easy to deploy.

## Quick Start
1. Deploy with **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or **Vercel**.
2. Replace placeholder images in `assets/`:
   - `portrait_placeholder.webp`
   - `byheartapp.webp`
   - `mlp_mixer.webp`
   - `bookstore.webp`
   - `favicon.png`
3. Update links or text in `index.html` as needed.

## Contact Form (Production)
- Replace the current `mailto:` approach with **Formspree**:
  - Create a Formspree form and replace the `submit` handler in `script.js`.
- Or use **EmailJS**.

## SEO
- Edit the `<title>` and meta description in `<head>` as you like.

Good luck with your interviews!
